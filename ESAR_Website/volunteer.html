	<h1>Volunteer Opportunities</h1>
	<h2>Foster</h2>
		<div class="container"></div>
		<p><strong>Foster</strong> - Not ready to adopt yet? Why not try fostering! We are always in need of foster homes for our precious pets.  You provide a home, basic care, love, and socialization that rescues so often desperately need - without the lifetime commitment.  Fosters are a crucial part of our operation and allow us to rescue in greater numbers as our homes fill up fast.</p>
	<h2>Volunteer</h2>
		<p><a href="http://www.meredith-zinner-photography.com/" target="_blank" id="meredithpix"><img src="images/Meredith.jpg" width="auto" height="150px" alt="Meredith taking photos"></a><strong>Staff Events</strong> - Year round we need volunteers to help staff our public weekend events at Unleashed locations on the UES and the UWS!  We need people willing to handle dogs, talk to the public, answer questions, walk dogs, monitor cages, and take applications for our awesome adoptables!</p>
		<p><strong>Volutneer Driver</strong> - If you have a car (or a zipcar account!) and are willing to donate your vehicle, gas and time, we would love to have you drive for us!  Whether it be to local events, a home visit to get an animal into his or her forever home, or do a long distance transport, driving around with us is always a good time!  And don't forget to buckle up and secure your precious cargo too!</p>
		<p><strong>Host a Fundraiser</strong> - Is your school or charity group looking for a way to support animals?  Host a fundraiser for your local group Eve's Sanctuary!  ie we've had a comedian do a show for us!  Another time one of our adopter's children suggested that his elementary school donate funds raised by a movie night showing 101 Dalmations.  Have an idea?  Send us your thoughts!</p>
	<h1>How to Apply</h1>
		<h2>Apply to Foster</h2>
		<p>We ask that you fill out the same application as you would to adopt, and go through the same application process including a home visit.  When you fillout the application, circle "foster", include names of dogs/cats that you would be interested in fostering (list all that you'd consider) and email it to us.  Note that applications submitted to other groups do not qualify; we need our complete document filled out, signed, and returned prior to scheduling a meeting with an animal. Complete applications can be emailed to <script>email();</script>.  Don't forget to sign, date and initial each page.</p>
		<h2> Apply to Volunteer</h2> 
		<p>Fill out our application, circle "volunteer" and kindly write us a note about how you'd like to help when you email it to us.  If you live in the immediate NYC area, have love in your heart, and a little time on your hands, please download and fill out all questions on our official group application.</p>
