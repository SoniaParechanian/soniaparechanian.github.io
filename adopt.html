	<h2 id="adopt">Available Adoptables</h2>
	<p>If you would like to apply to adopt, please fill out our application, circle "adopt" and tell us which animal(s) you are interested in being considered for, scan and email us your application.  We sometimes get multiple applications for the same animal. So`` if you are interested in more than one animal, please note this.  Tiny puppies for example can be very popular - we had a darling one-eyed, two-pound puppy Chihuahua set a record with over 10 applications!  That said, all animals aren't as lucky to be as young and photograph as well as Zac Efron, Elle Fanning or Selena Gomez.  So please keep in mind, with dogs there is a significant personality and behavioral differential and some people make a better match with a Jimmy Kimmel vs. a Brad Pitt and vice versa.  We spend time getting to know our dogs and have a fantastic record of matchmaking.  We do our best to match the goals and lifestyle of the people with the personality of the animal.  Our goal is a simple one - people and pets living happily ever after.</p>
	<p>Note that applications submitted to other groups do not qualify; we need our complete document filled out including initials on each page and signature. We must receive a complete application before we will schedule an introduction to an animal.</p>
	<section class="available">
	<h2>Our process</h2>
	<p>To ensure that our animals are well-placed and don't end up back in the system we follow a process that includes: 1. Application review, 2. Interview/chat with a volunteer, 3. Home visit, 4. Arange for the adopter to meet the animal (if meeting did not already take place at an adoption event), 5. Reference checks, and 6. Board review. Once a match is made and an adoption is approved by our board we sign a contract with the adopter, the adopter makes an adoption donation (amount varies by animal) and then we provide medical records.</p>
	<p>Post adoption, it is then the responsibility of the adopter to license the animal with the city, register the microchip and establish a relationship with their personal vet. If you do adopt, we look forward to receiving <a href="happytails.html">"Happy Tails"</a> pictures from you!</p>
