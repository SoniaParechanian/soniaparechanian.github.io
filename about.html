		<h2>About Us.  We save lives.</h2>
	</div>
<main role="main">
	<p>Founded in 2004, "Eve's Sanctuary" is an independent, no-kill, non-profit, all volunteer, animal rescue organization based in New York City. Dealing primarily with cats and dogs in imminent danger, Eve's Sanctuary has rehabilitated and placed countless animals into new homes. Through education sessions, community awareness, street / high risk shelter rescue, and public adoption events, they strive to save as many lives as possible while ensuring all animals are placed into responsible and loving homes primarily within the NYC area.</p>
	<p>As "New Hope Partners" with the New York City Animal Care and Control shelters, Eve's Sanctuary is able to pull animals from an overwhelmed system that may otherwise be forced to euthanize, and place them into their own no-kill sanctuary until permanent adoptive homes can be found. </p>
	<p>No salaries are paid and the rescue is funded primarily by the big hearts of its own volunteers and donations from the public. Animals undergoing evaluation and medical treatment are contained, but once healthy and behavior screen approved - the majority are placed in foster care so that they spend a minimal amount of time in cages. All animals are fully vaccinated, dewormed, spay/neutered, blood tested, and micro-chipped. Making happy "tails" out of previously uncertain fates. Help save a life, adopt a rescue animal today!</p>
	<h1>Testimonials</h1>
	<div>
	<p id="testimonial">“I had two dogs in the past so I was really surprised by how much I learned from the Eve's Sanctuary volunteer thqt came to my apartment to do my home visit before I adopted my pug Bagels. I am totally impressed by the volunteer's knowledge and the group's professionalism. Thank you!”  <strong>&#8275; Michael K., Midtown West</strong></p>
	<p id="testimonial2">“In this day and age, it’s hard to find a rescue you can trust. Eve's Sanctuary Animal Rescue was recommended to me by a friend, and now I know why – Keep up the good work!”  <strong>&#8275; Jesse P., Brooklyn Heights</strong></p>
	<p id="testimonial3">"After puppy-sitting a sweet Cavalier King Charles named Chloe last November, Charlie and I talked about how great it would be to do something for animals. When an email arrived the next day from Eve’s Sanctuary announcing they were showing animals available for adoption over on Broadway, we went over just to take our minds off Chloe. We were immediately impressed by this amazing rescue group’s devotion and commitment to their animals. They were also incredibly supportive of potential pet fosters and adopters. If it wasn’t for meeting this very special group of volunteers that evening, we would never have found Poochini, the most perfect-for-us puppy in the world. It’s been over a year, and we can’t imagine life without the little guy. We are beyond grateful to them for rescuing him, and recommend anyone looking for a furry new friend to contact Eve’s Sanctuary!"  <strong>&#8275; Bridget C., Columbus Circle</strong></p>
	<p id="testimonial4">"I took my search for a new dog very seriously. I visited a lot of dogs and met with a lot of people at different rescue groups, and the level of professionalism and dedication at Eve's Sanctuary was simply head and shoulders above the rest. It was always clear that their first priority was finding exactly the right match between their rescue animals and potential adopters. And there is no question that my dog Azure, the sweetest and loveliest little pup I could imagine, is absolutely perfect for me! Since I brought her home eight months ago, she has blossomed into a happy, affectionate girl who charms the pants off everyone she meets!  I'm looking forward to many, many more years of being greeted at the door by her kisses and being woken by her little paw on the side of my bed, asking to come up for a cuddle. I'm so grateful to Eve's Sanctuary for saving her, nursing her back to health, and giving her so much love along with her second chance at life. I know that NO ONE could have done a better job!"  <strong>&#8275; Rabi W., Upper East Side</strong></p>
	<p id="testimonial5">"The first time I applied for a dog I didn't get it.  I was extremely mad at the group.  I fell in love with the dog at first sight - it jumped in my arms and I thought it was meant to be.  How was I supposed to explain to my son why we didn't get the dog?  He was super disappointed.  I felt like they didn't think my family was good enough (I'm a single mom).  I avoided the block the group was showing on for a few weeks until my anger subsided and I let my son talk me into walking by the block the group showed on so he could see the dogs.  We saw another dog we liked and one of the volunteers recognized us and said hello.  We started chatting about the second dog's personality.  This time they thought we were a fit!  We had a home visit that day and adopted Lucy that night.  I can't believe I'd be saying this but I am so glad they didn't give us the first dog - he wasn't right for us.  Some things happen for a reason.  Lucy was worth waiting for.  Eve's Sanctuary is more like eHarmony than match.com, sometimes you just have to trust the system.  Thank you so much!!! <strong>&#8275; Tatiania V., Upper West Side</strong></p>
