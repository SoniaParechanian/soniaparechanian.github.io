		<h2>Foster</h2>
		<p><strong>Foster</strong> - Not ready to adopt yet? Why not try fostering! We are always in need of foster homes for our precious pets.  You provide a home, basic care, love, and socialization that rescues so often desperately need - without the lifetime commitment.  Fosters are a crucial part of our operation and allow us to rescue in greater numbers as our homes fill up fast.</p>
		<h2>Volunteer</h2>
		<p><a href="http://www.meredith-zinner-photography.com/" target="_blank" id="meredithpix"><img src="images/Meredith.JPG" width="auto" height="150px" alt="Meredith taking photos"></a><strong>Staff Events</strong> - We need volunteers year-round to help staff our public weekend events at Unleashed locations on the UES and the UWS!  We need people willing to handle dogs, talk to the public, answer questions, walk dogs, monitor cages, and take applications for our awesome adoptables!</p>
		<p><strong>Volunteer Driver</strong> - If you have a car (or a zipcar account!) and are willing to donate your vehicle, gas and time, we would love to have you drive for us!  Whether it be to local events, a home visit to get an animal into his or her forever home, or do a long-distance transport, driving around with us is always a good time!  And don't forget to buckle up and secure your precious cargo too!</p>
		<p><strong>Host a Fundraiser</strong> - Is your school or charity group looking for a way to support animals?  Host a fundraiser for your local group Eve's Sanctuary!  ie we've had a comedian do a show for us!  Another time one of our adopter's children suggested that his elementary school donate funds raised by a movie night showing 101 Dalmatians.  Have an idea?  Send us your thoughts!</p>

		<h2 class="whitehtwo">How to Apply to Foster  <a href="data/ESAR Application.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="images/social/adobePDFicon32x32.png"></a></h2>
		<p>To foster, fill out the same application as you would to adopt and circle "Foster".  Fosters go through the same application process (including a home visit) as those applying to adopt.  
		Please include names of dogs/cats that you are interested in potentially fostering (list all that you'd consider) and email the form.  Email your complete application to us - don't forget to sign, date and initial each page.</p>

		<p>To volunteer, fill out the same application as you would to adopt or foster but circle "Volunteer" and kindly include a note about how you'd like to help in your email.
